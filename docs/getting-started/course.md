### Environment generation

> **Experimental** feature.

Flaxo is able not only to a create a course repo but to generate a whole execution environment for a predefined set 
of configurations. Environment generation means creating and uploading all the sources, binaries and configs required 
for building the repository sources and running the tests.

| Language | Testing language | Testing framework | Build tool |
| -------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| Java | Java / Kotlin | Junit / Spek | Gradle |
| Kotlin | Kotlin | Junit / Spek | Gradle |
| ะก++ | Bash | Bash IO* | Bash |

\* - Simple Bash IO testing framework for C++ sources. 
It was written specifically for the case and will be replaced with community-driven framework.
An example of using the framework is [here](https://github.com/tcibinan/simple-cpp-project).

To enable environment generation while creating a course click on **Generate environment** checkbox in a course 
creation popup. Fill **Testing language** and **Testing framework** to specify the environment to generate.
