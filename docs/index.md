# Flaxo

Flaxo is a free educational platform for open-source programming courses. It helps tutors to do their job reducing 
the corresponding routine as much as possible. 

## Validation

Flaxo validates student solutions using several integrated services collecting information about solutions 
*automated testing* and *code style analysis* results. Moreover, system manages to search for plagiarism in 
the  student submissions. Several well-known services are responsible for the described analyses: **Travis**, 
**Codacy** and **MOSS**.

## Aggregation

Along with solution validations Flaxo provides simple and concise interface for tutors to  manage courses, tasks and 
solutions. All data including validations, reviews and other metadata is aggregated to describe a complete state 
of a programming course.

## Customization

Flaxo evolves in the direction to be modularized, configurable and simple at the same time. Therefore most parts of 
the system is configurable or will be.
